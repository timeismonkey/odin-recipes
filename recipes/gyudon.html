     <ol>
         <li>
            Combine onion, dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a medium saucepan or saucier and bring 
            to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add beef and cook, stirring until beef is cooked through and liquid has reduced down to an 
            intensely flavored broth, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger and simmer for 1 minute longer. 
            Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide rice between 2 to 3 bowls and top with beef and sauce mixture. 
            Garnish each bowl with a poached egg (if using), sliced scallions, 
            beni-shoga, and togarashi. Serve immediately.
        </li>
