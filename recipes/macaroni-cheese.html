        <li>
            Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water to cover. 
            Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. 
            Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely absorbed and macaroni 
            is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. 
            Add cheese. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continuously, 
            until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. 
            Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.
